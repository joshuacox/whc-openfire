# Reporting Issues

Docker is a relatively new project and is active being developed and tested by a thriving community of developers and testers and every release of docker features many enhancements and bugfixes.

Given the nature of the development and release cycle it is very important that you have the latest version of docker installed because any issue that you encounter might have already been fixed with a newer docker release.

For ubuntu users I suggest [installing docker](https://docs.docker.com/installation/ubuntulinux/) using docker's own package repository since the version of docker packaged in the ubuntu repositories are a little dated.

Here is the shortform of the installation of an updated version of docker on ubuntu.

```bash
sudo apt-get purge docker.io
curl -s https://get.docker.io/ubuntu/ | sudo sh
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install lxc-docker
```

Fedora and RHEL/CentOS users should try disabling selinux with `setenforce 0` and check if resolves the issue. If it does than there is not much that I can help you with. You can either stick with selinux disabled (not recommended by redhat) or switch to using ubuntu.

If using the latest docker version and/or disabling selinux does not fix the issue then please file a issue request on the [issues](https://github.com/sameersbn/docker-openfire/issues) page.

In your issue report please make sure you provide the following information:

- The host ditribution and release version.
- Output of the `docker version` command
- Output of the `docker info` command
- The `docker run` command you used to run the image (mask out the sensitive bits).

# Installation

Pull the `latest` version of the image from the docker index. This is the recommended method of installation as it is easier to update image in the future. These builds are performed by the **Docker Trusted Build** service.

```bash
docker pull sameersbn/openfire:latest
```

You can also pull a particular version of openfire by specifying the version. For example,

```bash
docker pull sameersbn/openfire:3.9.3-2
```

Alternately you can build the image yourself.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/sameersbn/docker-openfire.git
cd docker-openfire
docker build --tag="$USER/openfire" .
```

# Quick Start

Run the openfire image

```bash
docker run --name='openfire' -i -t --rm \
  -p 9090:9090 -p 5222:5222 -p 7777:7777 \
  sameersbn/openfire:3.9.3-2
```

Point your browser to `http://localhost:9090` and follow the setup procedure to complete the installation.

The following video by HAKK5 will help you with the configuration and give you an introduction to openfire and some of its features.

# Data Store

The openfire image is configured to save all configurations and installed plugins at `/data`. As such we should mount a volume at `/data`

Volumes can be mounted in docker by specifying the **'-v'** option in the docker run command.

```bash
mkdir /opt/openfire
docker run --name=openfire -d \
  -p 9090:9090 -p 5222:5222 -p 5223:5223 -p 7777:7777 \
  -p 7070:7070 -p 7443:7443 -p 5229:5229 \
  -v /opt/openfire:/data \
```

## Shell Access

For debugging and maintenance purposes you may want access the containers shell. If you are using docker version `1.3.0` or higher you can access a running containers shell using `docker exec` command.

```bash
docker exec -it openfire bash
```

If you are using an older version of docker, you can use the [nsenter](http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/nsenter.1.html) linux tool (part of the util-linux package) to access the container shell.

Some linux distros (e.g. ubuntu) use older versions of the util-linux which do not include the `nsenter` tool. To get around this @jpetazzo has created a nice docker image that allows you to install the `nsenter` utility and a helper script named `docker-enter` on these distros.

To install `nsenter` execute the following command on your host,

```bash
docker run --rm -v /usr/local/bin:/target jpetazzo/nsenter
```

Now you can access the container shell using the command

```bash
sudo docker-enter openfire
```

For more information refer https://github.com/jpetazzo/nsenter

# Upgrading

To upgrade to newer releases, simply follow this 3 step upgrade procedure.

- **Step 1**: Stop the currently running image

```bash
docker stop openfire
```

- **Step 2**: Update the docker image.

```bash
docker pull sameersbn/openfire:latest
```

- **Step 3**: Start the image

```bash
docker run -name openfire -d [OPTIONS] sameersbn/openfire:latest
```
